# Roman's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn as much as I can to help prepare myself for future projects within this program. I built this project because I wanted to get familiar with these coding languages and how to properly employ each of them into a webpage. The problem I solved through building this project was how to properly set-up a webpage and present it in a meaningful and engaging way. I feel like I have both learned a great amount about the in's and out's of developing but I also feel like I have just scratched the surface!
